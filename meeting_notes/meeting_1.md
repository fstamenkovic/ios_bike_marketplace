# Notes meeting 1  
The project is creating an end-to-end encryption chat app for iOS devices.  
The Trello board can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/dzuUnoZi/1st-sprint-planning)  

Notes:  
* Phone number used to sign up to ensure legitimacy of users  
* use cryptographic [libraries/APIs](https://cryptoswift.io/) to encrypt all messages using public key encryption  
* Use Firebase as the database  
* Delete messages after they've been open (Kind of like snapchat)  
* Potentially expand to images?  
* Alternative to Snapchat-like messages is to give user ability to delete messages for both themselves and the other person in the conversation.  

The group is to meet weekly on weekends for longer meetings and bi weekly on Slack for shorter meetings.   

This meeting was done on Slack and 7:00pm, November 5th 2019.
